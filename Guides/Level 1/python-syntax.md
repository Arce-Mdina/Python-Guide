## Python Comments
Comments are lines of text that will be ignored by Python when executing. This is useful to clearly split your code into a more readable manner or for debugging, such as when you want to know your mistakes, you can comment lines of code so that they are not executed anymore and you can work out what is wrong.

Python comments start with `#`. This indicates to Python that it should ignore the rest of the line. 

You can easily make text or code comments by using the shortcut `âŒ˜ + /` on a Mac, or `^ + /` on a Windows.
