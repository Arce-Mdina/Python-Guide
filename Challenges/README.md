Level 5:
- Introduction to libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, Pandas for data analysis)
- GUI programming basics (e.g., tkinter)
- Web development basics (e.g., Flask or Django)
- Final projects and real-world application development

# How the Challenges are made
The challenges are made according to the guide levels. You can access what contents of the each level is by going into the respective level's files. 

# Challenges Format
The format is the following:
- Challenge description - outlines what the challenge is and what you need to do
- Skills required - giving you a hint of what needed to be included in the solution as well as checking your own skills
- Possible solution - there could be many solutions to a single challenge, this only provides one of the solutions you could get (as long as the end result is the same, that is fine)
