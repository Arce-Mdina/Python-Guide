## What are Variables?
You can think of a variable as a space for storing data, much like your drawers storing your stationary and notebooks!

## Creating Variables
In Python, you can create a variable but just assigning to it (equal sign `=`).

Python does not really care about the type of data you assign it to, you can even change it afterwards!

```python
name = "Sally"
name = "John"
print(name)

# Output: John
# This is because the second assignment overrided the first value.
```
