## Python Output
We can output data by using the `print()` function. 
```python
print("Hello world!")

# Output: Hello world!
```
This function outputs whatever is between the brackets - for strings it removes the quotation marks.

This can also be used for variables.
```python
x = 4
print(x)
# Output: 4
```
### f-strings
There is something in Python called the f string, which is basically an easier to output something when a string needs one or more variable's data within it.

```python
x = input("What is your favourite color?")

print(f"Your favourite color is {x}")
```
